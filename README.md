Since a couple of months, I have got several queries from mechanical engineers like I am a mechanical engineer having X years of experience and I want to change my career to analytics, is it good option for me? Is it rewarding field? What are the skills required for it? How to start with it?  

So here are the answers to all such questions. It's not only limited to Mechanical Engineers but whomsoever willing to enter in this field can follow this path.  
  
1.  There are 3 different parts of analytics:  
                   
     a.  Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis  
    1. To know and explore the data  
    2. To get insight of the data  
    3. Mainly visualization part  
    4. Tools  
      a.	Tibco Spotfire, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and other open source visualization libraries like D3.JS
    5.	Techniques  
      a.	Mean, Mode, Median, Range, Percentile, Quantile, IQR, Variance, Standard Deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis,  
            Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis. 
          
    b. Predictive Analysis  
    1.	Based on historical data predict the future [Nature is difficult to predict]  
    2.	Tools  
        a.	R, Python, Rapid Miner, Orange, SAS, WEKA, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
    3.	Techniques  
        a.	Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Adaboost, Adabag, Na√Øve Bayes,   
              K Means Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Neural Network.  
            
    c.	Prescriptive Analysis
    1.	If we know the result or predict outcome of a particular event, what to do to make it better or prevent it or to change it as per          requirements.  
    
2.	Is it rewarding field? Yes, definitely it is a rewarding field because here supply of qualified professionals is low compare to the demand.  

3.	Is analytics as a career suitable for me? Or is it a right choice for me? I will suggest to go through the different MOOCs like Coursera, edX, Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare, Stanford Online Courses and take fewer courses on statistics, R and Python programming and try to evaluate yourself.  

4.	How much time it will take? Depends on your time availability and ability to understand and grasp the knowledge.  


5.	What are the skills required for it? Statistics and Coding broadly speaking, but if we drill it down, then it will be  
    a.	Linear Algebra, Probability Distribution, Integration and Differentials, Hypothesis Testing from Statistics side.  
    b.	Tools and Techniques mentioned in step 1, in tools it will be mainly R and Python.  
    
    
6.	How to start with it?  
    a.	First of all, starts with basics as shown in 5.a then go for 1.v.1 and then move to 1.b part.        
    b.	I will suggest that once you start to gain knowledge, start participating in online competition platforms like Kaggle, Analytics          Vidhya as well as practice on the freely available data through which you will gain insights of how to deal with different              types of data, which algorithm will work and which not, what to look before and after analysis, what to do if algorithms do not          work, how to evaluate the final result.    

7.	You can consider these 2 very good books as per their order for algorithms part:  
    a.	http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/			:-	Introduction to Statistical Learning   
    b.	https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/	:-	The Elements of Statistical Learning   

Here I have not included Deep Learning part i.e. Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding and Computer Vision which will require to learn set of tools like Keras, TensorFlow available as a package in Python and algorithms like Recurrent Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory [LSTM] and other flavors of multi-layer Neural Networks. I have also not included Big Data side part like, Hadoop Eco System, Spark, Scala, Kafka, Hive, Pig, Sqoop.   

Though the list provided here is not exhaustive but you can start your journey from here. The tools and techniques mentioned here are most widely used, but once you start the journey and dig down more, you will come across many more tools and techniques for different use cases.
